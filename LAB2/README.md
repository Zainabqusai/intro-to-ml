Project Title: Luxury Watch Price Prediction
Dataset Description: The dataset contains detailed specifications of luxury watches. It includes features such as Brand, Model, Case Material, Strap Material, and Movement Type. Additionally, it provides technical dimensions like Case Diameter (mm), Case Thickness (mm), and Band Width (mm), as well as functional details like Water Resistance, Power Reserve, and Complications.

Machine Learning Problem: This is a Regression task. The objective is to predict the continuous numerical value of the watch's Price (USD) based on its physical attributes and technical specifications.

Objective: By analyzing these technical features, the model aims to estimate the market value of a watch. This is useful for understanding how specific materials (like Titanium vs. Steel) or technical complexities influence the final price in the luxury market.
